# Spring-Boot-Practices
50 Best Practices, tips and tricks for using Spring Boot effectively with Java

- [ ] Use an external configuration server
> By using an external configuration server, you can store your configuration properties in a central location that is separate from your application code. This allows you to change the configuration of your application without rebuilding and redeploying the code. You can use tools like [Spring Cloud Config](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/docs/current/reference/html/) to manage your configuration properties and inject them into your application at runtime.
- [ ] Use the right dependencies
> Spring Boot provides a lot of useful dependencies that you can include in your project, such as [Spring Security](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/index.html), [Spring Data](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/), and [Spring Web](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html). However, be mindful of the dependencies you include, as each one adds to the size of your application and could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities or other issues. It’s important to only include the dependencies that you actually need in your application. You can use tools like the [Spring Boot starter](https://start.spring.io/) parent POM to manage your dependencies and ensure that you only include the ones that you need.
- [ ] Keep your application modular
> As your application grows, it’s important to keep it modular and maintainable. Use packages to organize your code and consider using the package-by-feature approach, where each package represents a specific feature or functionality of your application. This will help you keep your code organized and make it easier to find and maintain.
- [ ] Use caching wisely
> Caching can improve the performance of your application by reducing the number of trips to the database. However, be mindful of the cache invalidation strategy and ensure that your cache is consistent with the data in the database. It’s important to choose a cache invalidation strategy that is appropriate for your application and to monitor the [cache](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-cache-tutorial) to ensure that it is working as expected.
- [ ] Monitor and log your application
> Use tools like [Log4j](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/index.htm), [Slf4j](https://www.baeldung.com/slf4j-with-log4j2-logback) or [Logback](https://stackify.com/logging-logback/) to monitor and log your application. These are powerful logging frameworks that you can use to log messages from your application. By monitoring and logging your application, you can troubleshoot issues and identify performance bottlenecks.
- [ ] Use a consistent code style
> Establishing a consistent code style will make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code. You can use tools like [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/) and [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/) to enforce a consistent code style and catch common coding mistakes.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
> Testing is an important part of the development process, and it’s especially important when building microservices or standalone applications. Use tools like [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) to write unit and integration tests for your application. This will help you catch bugs early and ensure that your application is working as expected.
- [ ] Use a load balancer
> If you are building a microservice-based application, it’s important to use a load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of your service. This will help you scale your application and improve its reliability. You can use tools like [Netflix Eureka](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/docs/current/reference/html/#:~:text=Eureka%20is%20the%20Netflix%20Service,registered%20services%20to%20the%20others.) or [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) to implement a load balancer in your application.
- [ ] Use a consistent logging format
> Using a consistent logging format will make it easier to parse and understand the logs generated by your application. You can use tools like [Logback](https://stackify.com/logging-logback/) or [Log4j](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/log4j/index.htm) to configure the logging format for your application.
